Flow Service APIs
-----------------

Flow Service APIs  provide high level abstractions that can be used by programmers to define and install flow rules on network devices. 

Topology Service APIs
---------------------

Topology Service APIs provide high level abstractions that can be used by programmers to retrieve topology information such as list of hosts, network devices, links. In addition, Topology Service APIs also provide a set of path finding algorithms that can be used to find end-to-end paths between two end points in a network topology.

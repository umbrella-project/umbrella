# What is Umbrella? 

Umbrella is a unified software defined development framework that provides  a new set of APIs for implementing of SDN applications, keeping the abstractions independent of the Northbound APIs used by specific SDN controllers. The main design goals are: 

* Design and implement a development framework that provides a new set of abstractions for SDN applications, keeping the abstractions independent of the NB APIs used by specific SDN controllers.

* Design and implement a set of modules that use the proposed abstractions to provide information needed by SDN applications, such as topology, network statistics, and real time topology changes.
    
* Increase portability of SDN applications across SDN controllers, and make it easy for a programmer to evaluate a specific application on multiple SDN controllers (e.g., to compare performance).
    
* Provide a software defined network programming framework that reduces programming complexity, allows a programmer to write SDN applications without requiring a programmer to master low-level details for each SDN controller, and avoids locking an application to a specific controller.

* Provides a framework uses a hybrid approach that utilizes both of reactive and proactive approach for managing and programming of SDN networks that offers better scalability than a completely reactive network management.
